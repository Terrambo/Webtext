Has your cloud experience been hitting turbulance or storm clouds instead?
Bandwidth, object size, and even time of day can really effect your cloud experience. Navigating around the storm clouds may be difficult and expensive,leading to an increased cost or expensive solutions to better the cloud experience. We have set out to offer a whole new way of getting there and staying extremely efficient, avoiding the storms and reducign the turbulance. 

Autobahn is here, using our novel algorithms for data avoidance. Users to save up to 98% on bandwidth and cloud storage. Depending on the data type, data avoidence could be the fastest tool on the market, helping save you time and money.


Would you like to see just efficient you could be? 

We are sure you would, so why not test it first. 
We do not want our customers disappointed so we developed Tachometer. This simple command line tool can analyse your data and will predict the data avoidence rate. It currently, in a read only mode, will check your local storage and AWS S3 to generate a nice graphical overview on just how much bandwidth and storage can be saved.

** This is alternate text, so that there is a more "super highway" type of analogy to our software. 

Regardless of how you get somewhere, traffic, tolls and storge space can be expensive. As the population grows so does the transportation needed. Tolls get more expensive, there is more congestion on the motorways, public transportation costs go up and parking grages are becoming more expensive. All of this makes moving from one location to another more and more a luxury. 

When applying this to public or private clouds the same problems arise, eventually making it a luxury and not a commodity. Yes, it is cheaper than hardware and data centers, but moving there can sometimes be expensive, time consuming, and slow.

Autobahn has been designed to keep a commodity a commodity - low prices, simple to use, very efficient and affordable. Imagine, by just using a novel approach to data avoidence you could save up to 90%+ on bandwidth, storage and time. All this and still be as effective as you are now.
